# OpenSight: Sales Intelligence System - Resume & Demo Artifacts

## Resume Entry (Data Analyst / Developer)
Developed an open-source Sales Intelligence Platform (OpenSight) that ingests raw CSV/Google Sheets data, computes key metrics (CAC, LTV, conversion rates), and generates executive summaries. Implemented rule-based anomaly detection and a responsive dashboard used by pilot clients. Reduced manual reporting time by 90% for small businesses.

## Demo Script
"Hi, I'm Farhan Ahmed. Today I'll show you OpenSight, a free sales intelligence tool I built. We start by uploading a CSV of sales data. The system automatically cleans it, detects duplicates, and normalises currencies. Within seconds, the dashboard updates with daily revenue, conversion funnels, and channel breakdowns. If there's a significant drop, an alert appears with a suggested action. Finally, I can generate a PDF leakage report that summarises where leads are lost and what to do next."
